                <h1>A little bit about Mario's!</h1>
                <p>Mario's is the best Mexican food in town. Previously known as "Pedro's Place", Marios takes all the best menu items and has them ready for you at an affordable price! Community is a really large part of Mario's and we take pride in that. The 'Redskin' burrito was dedicated to the Chowchilla Redskins turning 100 years! This burrito is one of the most popular items ordered, and it's not even officially on the Menu! If you like Mexican food, you'll love Mario's!</p>
